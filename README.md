# LEGO Tracker Sinatra Back-End

## This is the Back-End API for the LEGO Set Tracker SPA

### Description:

Fork and clone this into a directory used with the Front-End. You can find out more information on how this works with the Front-End on its repo [HERE](https://github.com/Kalunodragon/lego-tracker-react-frontend).

### Notes:
The Seed data in the `db/seeds.rb` file has some sets that are owned by the coder, there are also a few named people added as well as a bunch of random notes and a bunch of random named people. Feel free to create your own seed data or feel free to use the application without it!
